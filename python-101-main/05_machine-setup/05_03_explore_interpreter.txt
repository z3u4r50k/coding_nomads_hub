Explore the interpreter:

- Execute lines with syntax error and see what the response is.
  - What happens if you leave out a quotation or parenthesis?
  If you leave the quotation provides a:
  File "<stdin>", error and directs the error line, as well as shows that
  the error is similar to a pattern hightlighting what I am probably missing.
  - How helpful are the error messages?

  If I do miss a parenthesis I get "three dots" waiting to either continue coding 
  or probably closing the parenthesis.

- Use the `help()` function to explore what you can do with the interpreter.
  - For example execute `help('print')`.
  - Press `q` to exit.
